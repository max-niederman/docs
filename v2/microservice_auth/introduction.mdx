# Introduction

This guide explains how you can achieve auth between microservices using SuperTokens. When microservice `M1` wants to talk to microservice `M2`, `M1` will start by creating a JWT (by contacting the SuperTokens core), and pass that JWT to `M2`.

`M2` will then verify the JWT, check that it's created by another microservice, and only then proceed with serving the request.

In the next sections, we will be showing you how to create and verify a JWT using SuperTokens.
